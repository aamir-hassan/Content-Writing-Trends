# 6 Content Writing Trends for 2021: An SEO Content Checklist for SMBs

As small businesses head into 2021 with endless hope that this pandemic ends, marketing dollars are scarce.

And from the looks of things, this marketing spend will continue its scarcity throughout 2021, especially if additional statewide or citywide shutdowns occur.

One advantage of this situation?

Refining your business website’s content writing with the latest trends of SEO in mind.

Many SMBs either have content writers and/or SEO professionals on staff, or work with digital marketing agencies.

Regardless of the situation, one thing you should not do during this pandemic is to become lazy.

My agency sees it over and over again, whether working with local environmental engineering firms or enterprise companies.

Many follow the digital marketing practices of the last decade, especially across their website content writing.

Throughout 2020, I not only revised my agency’s marketing and pricing strategies to cater to client needs – I also blocked time to focus additional energy on what content writing trends can further help clients succeed in SEO and brand awareness in 2021.


This included looking at what worked for my clients throughout 2020, and what trends I had discovered.

The study helped shape a checklist for optimizing your website’s content writing using the latest SEO trends.

But first, a few content writing trend practices in regards to brand authority within a small business, and how to strengthen it through your website’s content.

2021 Content Writing Trends
In 2021, your brand authority will matter more than ever.

For most SMBs, the focus is on strengthening the overall company name itself versus the actual human being or beings behind the companies.

This is a mistake.

The more you can center a single person as the expert and authoritative figure that represents a business, the better.

Founders and CEOs typically follow this role, something familiar with giant corporations (think Howard Schultz, Elon Musk, or Tim Cook).

Most smaller businesses, though, have multiple voices representing their company.

This occurs across all marketing material, with the largest offender being the blog.

If you have various experts on staff or freelancing for you, having separate authors for topics is ideal.

Take digital marketing agencies.

Experts in social media should write about social media, and experts in content marketing should write about content marketing, and, well, you get it.

The problem with many smaller businesses is they have only a few core services but continue to byline stuff as “staff” or even use fictitious names.

This provides zero identity to the company and doesn’t help the business build a strong following and repeated visits to that website.

The solution is to take one of these high authority figures within an SMB – again, typically a founder or CEO – and make them the voice of the content across that website.

The more niche the service or product, the more optimal it is to use a singular voice.

Think about a company selling stock investment services – would you trust the voice of the CEO or the voice of some unknown on the marketing staff?

With that said, it’s always smart to write in first-person pronouns.

Either “I” as the authoritative figure or “we” from the voice of the authoritative figure representing the company.

Back to digital marketing agencies.

Again, it’s wise to have experts writing on their specialized topics.

But also get the CEO involved.

This is where ghostwriting helps progress sales.

Even better is if the CEOs like to write and do the work themselves (or at least provide a bullet-point outline for your writer or agency).

Another trend I see is more traditional PR approaches such as media outreach, especially for those clients with a strong local base (think restaurants, auto service centers, massage therapy, etc.).

Local online and traditional news publications have much clout, and many of the reporters working for those publications are always on the hunt for local business angles.
